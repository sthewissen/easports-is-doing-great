In preparation for the World Cup mode a bunch of new players got added. However, a bunch of players also get themselves renamed to "0". Pictured below we have Kevin de Bruyne who will be known as Mr. 0 from here on out. He was not alone though, since we saw icons and other high-rated players also get accidentally renamed to "0".
