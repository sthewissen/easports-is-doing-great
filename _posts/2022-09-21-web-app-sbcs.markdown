The FUT 23 Web App is out! Finally, time to start grinding SBCs, make coins, get your started squad in place, and more! Except for some SBCs, which are configured in such a way that they're not completable. There's a total of 3 SBCs spread across the Nations and Leagues sections that can't be completed even though the solutions should technically work. Did we mention that all packs are untradeable too?
