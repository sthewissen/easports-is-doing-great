The new RTTK Foundations Pack in the store has some rather questionable odds. There is a loan player in these packs to which most of these high odds probably apply. However, when you're just casually looking at this at first glance you would think that this is a great value pack. It mostly contains low-rated rare golds besides the loans though.
