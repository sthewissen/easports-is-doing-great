The new RTTK Foundations pack has some rather questionable odds. In a world where EA is already in some gambling predicaments in specific countries one can only describe these odds as questionable. There is a loan player in these packs to which most of these high odds probably apply. If you're just looking at this at first glance you would think that this is a great value pack though. Let us tell you; it isn't.
