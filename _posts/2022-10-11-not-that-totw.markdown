Everyone's favorite EA communication channel **EA Direct** came out to let us know that some of the TOTW items that were distributed in the Loan & Untradeable Players Pack (that was already rather suspect to begin with) were not from the right TOTW. Darn these interns that can't tell their 1s from their 2s.
