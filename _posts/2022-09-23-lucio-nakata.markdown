Today we learnt that the **Nakata (87 OVR)** and **Lucio (89 OVR)** cards were released with the Premier League and Bundesliga respectively, instead of both of them being Serie A. EA Sports has already communicated that the two cards have been updated with the correct League and that those who have purchased these cards from the transfer market will be contacted in-game and refunded their spent coins.
