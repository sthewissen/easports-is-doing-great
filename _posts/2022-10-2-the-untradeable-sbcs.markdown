Let's celebrate Erling Haaland's recent transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester City! EA does this by giving you an untradeable Small Rare Gold Player pack. However, they never told you it was going to be untradeable. The **Newcomer's Challenge** SBC that was released earlier has a similar problem. EA has come out and said that they adjusted the description of the SBCs and will compensate.
