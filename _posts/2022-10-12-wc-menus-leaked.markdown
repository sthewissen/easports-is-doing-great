It looks a bit wonky, but it's something. Just like the game accidentally launching a month early, we have now found out through FUT Mentor that the World Cup is starting early too! You can already get a sneak peek at the menus for the World Cup modes in FIFA 23. It seems like the trick only works on PlayStation 5 though, because it involves starting a special World Cup multiplayer activity.
