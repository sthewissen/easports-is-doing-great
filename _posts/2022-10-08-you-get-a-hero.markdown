Oof, this is a big one. Today EA decided it was time for a good, old-fashioned, unexpected market crash. The store had a guaranteed FUT Hero pack listed for 25K coins. While the pack was up for a mere 20 minutes, the effects on the market have been enormous. People cashed out and prices dumped. EA has not spoken out about the incident, and we're wondering if they ever will.
