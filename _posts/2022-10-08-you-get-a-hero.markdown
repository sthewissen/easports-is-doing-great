Today our friends at EA decided it was time for a good, old-fashioned market crash. The store had a guaranteed FUT Hero pack listed for 25K coins. While the pack was up for a mere 20 minutes, the effects on the market were enormous. People cashed in and prices dumped. EA has not spoken out about the incident. They are probably out buying a rug to sweep this one under.
