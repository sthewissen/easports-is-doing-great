Today EA Sports thought it was a great day to start their tally for FIFA 23. Even though EA is sometimes referred to as being very hungry to get their hands on your hard earned cash, they have given a few people a nice deal recently. The Ultimate Edition of FIFA 23, which is supposed to sell for 4799 Indian Rupees, was listed for 4.8 Rupee instead, which equals roughly $0.06. People that got in on the deal have received confirmation that EA will honor their purchase. How nice of them! Obviously this was quickly patched and probably cost the employee responsible his wage for this year.
