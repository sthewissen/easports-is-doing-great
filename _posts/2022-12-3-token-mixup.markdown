Today we got a new batch of World Cup Swaps tokens. However, the tokens EA Sports put out were tokens they already released earlier in the promo. People getting duplicate tokens, which meant they couldn't open any packs anymore unless they either used or discarded tokens. Not a great look. The tokens have been updated since, but it's not known what happened with people who discarded them.
