Licensing is a serious matter when it comes to FIFA 23. We are being treated to having Juventus back in, but other Italian teams such as Atalanta, AS Roma, Lazio, and Napoli are still unlicensed. Today, EA Sports decided they'd use the Napoli badge as an SBC icon, regardless of licensing. That'll be another interns entire paycheck that'll have to be paid to someone else.
