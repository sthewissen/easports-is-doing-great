Today EA Sports thought it was a great day to get their mistakes counter running. We're still weeks away from an official release, but the game is already playable on Xbox in select scenarios. Obviously, ratings are being leaked left right and center, no matter how hard EA tries to DCMA these posts. Luckily no one truly fears EA. Thereâ€™s currently no word on how EA will handle this leak.
